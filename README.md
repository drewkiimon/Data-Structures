# Data-Structures
Independently created data structures such as BST, linked list, stack, queue, etc.

My goal of this repository is not only to grasp a better understanding of data structures that 
are essential to computer science and developing code, but also to practice implementing these
structures in different programming languages. I am starting to write all these data structures in
Python, then proceed to C++, Java, and any other programming language I feel necessary. 

Feel free to look at the code and use it for whatever needed. However, please make sure you 
understand it and if you are confused, ask me a question. I'm trying to learn with you and by myself, 
so don't be afraid to ask.
